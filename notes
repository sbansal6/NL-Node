Idea:-
Auto Tagging system

Example :- (Auto tagging system)
Denormalize database using sql

#mysql #sql


Uses of natural language processing (basically done on text data)
1) sentiment analysis
2) auto tagging text,
3) spam detection
4) identetying themes from text
5) tokenizitation
6) auto summaring text
7) classifting text

Steps in NLP
1) Tokenization (breakdown text into words and sentences) ->
2) Stopword Removal(filtering out common words) ->
3) N-Grams(Identify commonly occuring groups of words) ->
   Example ;-
   N-Grams:- (In the sentence below New York is twice so its Bigrams :))
   New York is a great city.Have you ever been to New York
4) Word Sense Disambiguation :- (identify meaning of word based on context the word is used in)
   Example :- (the these two sentences below, meaning of cool is different)
       The movie had really cool effects.
       I will have glass of cool water
5) Parts of speech tagging:- (like identifying noun very adj in sentence)

6) Stemming :-Example:- words like
    Close
    Closed
    Closely
    if we want to treat the words the same , we can use stemming technique to use the root
    of the words , clo in this example


TYPES OF ML PROBLEMS
1) classification: spam detections, generes
   classfiers are the algorithims
   classification is known ahead of time (like spam or ham)
   algo examples:- Naive Bayes or support vector machine

2) Clustering:-  devide article into groups.
                 groups are unknown at start
                 didnt know this existed
                 Explore data, patterns

                 algorithims examples:- k means, hierarchical clustering
3) Recommendations
4) regressions:-

 --=================================

 Typical ML Workflow:-

1) Pick your problem (identify which type of problem we need to
   solve)
2) Represent Data:- Represent data using numeric attributes
   Numeric attributes :-  text to numeric - features
   example;- term frequency
             tf-idf
3) Apply an algorithim:- (use a standard algo to find a model)
   a mathematical equation
   rules

#Project 1:- Auto summarize text (using rule base approach)
1) find most important words in text (words that occur more frequently)
2) compute a significance score for sentences based on words they contain
   (sum of importance of all the words in that sentence)
3) pick the most signifcance sentences
4)


#Project 2: classification using clustering
feature extraction using the bag of words model (numeric attributes)
k means clustering
k near by

#extracting meaningful numeric attributes to represent text is called feature extraction
some of methods of feature extraction are
1) Term frequency :- Bag of words model.
   frequency (0,1) of a word appearing in bag of words
   *** order is lost


2) TF_IDF:- (Inverse document frequency) :- weight the term frequencies to take
            the rarity of a word into account

            weight  = 1 / number of documents the word apprears in
